# Questions {.unnumbered .unlisted}

-   Homework?
-   Project?
-   R?
-   Quarto?

# Learning Objectives

1.  Confirm comprehension of Simulation and coding topics to this point
    
2.  Review Project in Detail


# Check on Learning

## Simulation Concepts

### Distributions

-   Where do distributions come from?
-   What information can we get from them?
-   If we have a distribution, how do we simulate data with it?
-   If we have data, how do we figure out which distribution it came from?
-   What is the relationship between a system process and a distribution?

### Simulations

-   Why do we do simulations?
-   What is the most important step in a simulation?
-   How do we do one?

## Quarto

-   Why are we using Quarto?
-   What does Quarto give you?
-   How do you use R and Quarto?

## Implementation in R

-   Reading and manipulating data
-   Tidy data vs. Matrix data. Wide-form tidy vs. Long-form tidy
-   Creating Plots
-   Sampling distributions
-   Functions, Loops, control flow, variables
-   Fitting distributions
-   Animations

# Project

-   Why am I doing this?
-   Why is there a project proposal due?
