However, this isn’t really the full story. What we want to see is how the system changes at each arrival and departure. To do this, we will need to create a new data frame that has an entry for each arrival and departure. Additionally, we’ll want the numbers indicated to be horizontal lines with discontinuities showing when the number changes. Also, this is not exactly the bounds of our simulation because we cutoff our arrivals at \\(t_f\\), but we have departures after that time. So we should only be plotting up to \\(t_f\\).\n\ndata |&gt; ggplot(aes(x=arrival_time, y=L_q)) +\n  geom_line(color=\"cornflowerblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Queue Length Over Time\",\n    x = \"Time (min)\",\n    y = \"Number of Customers in Queue\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Queue Length Over Time\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way these lines are connected give an indication that the queue length is in between two integers at most times. Line plots can be misleading in this way. We need a step plot. Also, we are essentially only sampling the system at a time that somebody arrives. This is why we are seeing big jumps. We should only be seeing the line move up or down one at a time.\n\nEvent Log\nBasically, we need to unpack the simulation data so that it is event-centric rather than customer-centric.\n\n# all events are either arrivals or departures\n# create a dataframe which tracks all events\n# combines arrival and departure times into single vector, event time\n# for arrivals, event is +1\n# for departures, event is -1\n\nevents &lt;- data |&gt;\n  # bringing the data I want to work with\n  select(arrival_time, departure_time) |&gt; \n  \n  # turning the data from wide to long\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = everything(),\n    names_to = \"event_type\",\n    values_to = \"event_time\") |&gt; \n  \n  # assigning -1 if departure and 1 if arrival\n  mutate(\n    event = ifelse(event_type == \"arrival_time\", 1, -1)) |&gt;\n  \n  # adding an initial condition of time=0 and 0 customers\n  bind_rows(tibble(event_time = 0, event = 0)) |&gt;\n  \n  # removing the event type column\n  select(-event_type) |&gt;\n  \n  # sorting the data by event time\n  arrange(event_time)\n\n# cumulative sum of events\nevents &lt;- events |&gt; mutate(\n  L = cumsum(event),\n  # pmax is vectorized function that looks at each element rather than the entire thing\n  L_q = pmax(0, L - 1)  \n)\n\nhead(events)\n\n\n\n\n\nevent_time\nevent\nL\nL_q\n\n\n\n\n0.000000\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2.878761\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n4.218065\n-1\n0\n0\n\n\n6.119986\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n10.363377\n1\n2\n1\n\n\n10.575490\n-1\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could plot this by adding each column to the plot one at a time, but this can get messy. Instead we’ll do a pivot_longer so that the data is in a better format for plotting multiple series together.\nHere I’m pivoting from a wide format (have both an L and an L_q column) to a long format which just has the x-value of time and the y-value of L or L_q. This makes plotting much easier.\n\nevents_long &lt;- events |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(L, L_q), \n    names_to = \"metric\", \n    values_to = \"value\"\n  )\n\nhead(events_long)\n\n\n\n\n\nevent_time\nevent\nmetric\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n0.000000\n0\nL\n0\n\n\n0.000000\n0\nL_q\n0\n\n\n2.878761\n1\nL\n1\n\n\n2.878761\n1\nL_q\n0\n\n\n4.218065\n-1\nL\n0\n\n\n4.218065\n-1\nL_q\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt last, Figure 5 shows a complete plot of the number of customers in line and the number in the system at each moment.\n\nevents_long |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = event_time, y = value, color=metric)) +\n  xlim(0, t_f) +\n  geom_step(direction = \"hv\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Customer Count Over Time\",\n    x = \"Time (min)\",\n    y = \"Customers\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Customer Count Over Time",
