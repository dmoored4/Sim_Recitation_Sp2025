The breakdown rate follows an exponential distribution with a rate of one per 2000 hours of operation. How many breakdowns should be anticipated per year?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this information we can simply take the parameter, \\(\\lambda\\), and multiply it by the hours in a year and the total number of turbines to get the expected number of failures in the year.\n\\[\nX \\sim Exp \\left( \\lambda = \\frac{1}{2,000\\ hrs} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nf_X(t | \\lambda) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t}\n\\]\n\\[\nN = 300\\ turbines \\frac{365\\ days}{year} \\frac{24\\ hrs}{day} \\frac{1\\ breakdown/turbine}{2,000\\ hrs} = 1,314\\ breakdowns/year\n\\]\n\n\nThis is a silly problem to simulate, but we will do it anyway. We have a few options:\n\nSample \\(X\\) to get breakdown times and see how many we get in one year. Then multiply that by 300\nSample \\(X\\) to get breakdown times for each turbine and add them all together\nDo (1) or (2) for \\(N\\) years and then divide the result by \\(N\\). (\\(N\\) could be less than 1. What does that mean?)\nRecognize Exponential gives failure times, Poisson gives failures in a given time. Use that instead"
